# Live-coding-535
This repo will be for all live coding exercises that I create for ENT 535. Please notice that this repo holds Quarto docs/ htmls, R scripts, and markdown documents. 

My collaborator on this effort is my mentor, 535 instructor, and committee member, **Dr. Sara Hermann.**

If you have questions or feedback, please reach out to (Jared Adam *at* psu *dot* edu)
