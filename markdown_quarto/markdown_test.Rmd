```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# How doe this work?

## Smaller heading

### Even smaller heading

#### On and on it goes

##### Visual vs source 

And what about that outline?? 

## Lettuce write some stuff out

I want to include a link to Line Rider in my document <https://www.linerider.com/>.

And here is a link to a support page <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html>.

How about some **bold** followed by some *italics*

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## How about a code chunk without an output?

```{r, results='hide'}
summary(cars)

```
